    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

    <h5>Meridian PAL Soccer Referee</h5>
    <p>
      Worked as a soccer referee for the Meridian Police Activities League from
      September 2017 to May 2020. This taught me skills in dealing with
      difficult customers and of how to work with kids. These are skills I've
      carried with me into future jobs.
    </p>
    <h5>Roaring Springs Food and Beverage</h5>
    <p>
      Worked in the food and beverage department at Roaring Springs Waterpark
      from May 2020 to August 2021. I learned food servie safety standards while
      working in this job. I also learned to deal with money and difficult
      customers. This really shaped who I am as an employee.
    </p>
    <h5>Meridian Pool</h5>
    <p>
      Worked in the Meridian Pool as a lifeguard, swim lesson instructor, and
      front office lady from April 2022 to August of 2025. This job was where I
      learned to lifeguard and teach swim lessons. I worked with children of all
      ages and also adults. I worked in the front office and was a headguard to
      help keep an eye on the other guards as well.
    </p>
    <h5>West Boise YMCA</h5>
    <p>
      Worked as a lifeguard and swim lesson instructor at the West Boise YMCA
      from August 2023-April 2024. This was my second lifeguarding job, and I
      would say it built on the skills I learned at the Meridian Pool. This job
      also helped me learn how to adapt skills I already have to new work
      enviroments.
    </p>
    <h5>Grizzly Pool</h5>
    <p>
      Worked as a swim lesson instructor at the Grizzly Pool from August
